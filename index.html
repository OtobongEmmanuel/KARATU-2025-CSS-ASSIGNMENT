          <h2>Talk about yourself</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! My name is <b>Otobong Emmanuel Sunday</b>, a student of
            Cloud Engineering at AltSchool Africa. I hold a Bachelor of Science
            (BSc) degree in Architecture and have worked on several
            architectural projects. This experience strengthened my
            problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to learn
            quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, my interest shifted toward technology, especially cloud
            computing. I became curious about how the internet works and started
            learning about cloud infrastructure. Despite challenges, I pursued
            self-learning and built a basic understanding of cloud services and
            recently gained admission to study Cloud Engineering with AltSchool
            Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m now focused on becoming a cloud engineer, with a goal to build
            scalable solutions that empower communities and businesses. I
            believe technology has the power to drive positive change, and I’m
            excited to be part of that journey.

          <h2>Aspirations In Life</h2>
          <p>
            My aspiration and ambitions tend towards becoming an industry
            expert, creating value, providing support to the less priviledged
            and ultimately leaving a good mark in the sands of time. I believe
            this can be achieved by being consistent, disciplined and constantly
            being committed to achieve these ambitions.
